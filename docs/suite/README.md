# Suite Integration

**Domain**: Shared navigation, template system, landing page, dev environment

## Current State Summary

Phase 0 is complete. The Envoy Financial Intelligence Suite has a shared `base.html` Jinja2 template, a suite landing page with 3 tool cards (ISM Report Analysis, Financial News Analysis, Portfolio Intelligence), a consistent navbar across all tools, and a honcho-based dev environment that starts all services with a single command.
