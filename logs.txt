The New Orders Index hasn’t indicated consistent growth since a 24-month streak of expansion ended in May 2022. “Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, only one (Computer & Electronic Products) reported increased new orders. Panelists noted a continued level of uncertainty and concern about a lack of new order activity — with a 1-to-1.6 ratio of positive comments versus those expressing concern — and their confidence in the future economic environment remains at its lowest levels since the coronavirus pandemic recovery,” says Fiore. A New Orders Index above 52.3 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Census Bureau’s series on manufacturing orders (in constant 2000 dollars).', 'Production': 'The Production Index continued in contraction territory in August, registering 44.8 percent, 1.1 percentage points lower than the July reading of 45.9 percent. Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, only Computer & Electronic Products reported increased production. The index is at its lowest level since May 2020, when it registered 34.2 percent. “Panelists’ companies reduced output levels compared to July. New order rates remain weak, and backlog levels continue to decline. Companies continue to avoid investing in inventory due to the current economic uncertainty,” says Fiore. An index above 52.2 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Federal Reserve Board’s Industrial Production figures.', 'Employment': 'ISM’s Employment Index registered 46 percent in August, 2.6 percentage points higher than the July reading of 43.4 percent. The July and August readings are among the four lowest recorded since the index registered 43.7 percent in July 2020, early in the economic recovery; the others are 45.9 percent in February and 45 percent in July 2023. “The index contracted for the third consecutive month after an expansion in May, which broke a seven-month streak of contraction. Of the six big manufacturing sectors only Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products expanded employment in August, primarily due to seasonality factors. Respondents’ companies are continuing to reduce head counts through layoffs, attrition and hiring freezes. Sentiment in August indicated continued staff reductions compared to July, supported by the approximately 1-to-1.2 ratio of hiring versus head-count reduction comments,” says Fiore. An Employment Index above 50.3 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on manufacturing employment.', 'Supplier Deliveries': 'Delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations was marginally slower in August, with the Supplier Deliveries Index registering 50.5 percent, a 2.1-percentage point decrease compared to the reading of 52.6 percent reported in July. This is the second month of slower deliveries after four consecutive months of faster deliveries. After a reading of 52.4 percent in September 2022, the index went into contraction territory the following month and remained there until February. Of the six big industries, three (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Transportation Equipment) reported slower supplier deliveries in August. “Supplier deliveries are stabilizing as panelists’ companies continue to rely on their suppliers to manage their purchased material inventories, putting strain on the supply chain,” says Fiore. A reading below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries, while a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries.', 'Inventories': 'The Inventories Index registered 50.3 percent in August, up a substantial 5.8 percentage points compared to the reading of 44.5 percent reported in July. “Manufacturing inventories grew as a result of panelists’ companies adjusting to lower new output levels and the subsequent timing issues. Of the six big industries, five (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; and Chemical Products) reported increased manufacturing inventories in August,” says Fiore. An Inventories Index greater than 44.4 percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) figures on overall manufacturing inventories (in chained 2000 dollars).', "Customers' Inventories": 'ISM’s Customers’ Inventories Index registered 48.4 percent in August, up 2.6 percentage points compared to the 45.8 percent reported in July. “Customers’ inventory levels decreased at a slower rate in August, with the index moving upward to approach the lower end of ‘just right’ territory. This means panelists are reporting their companies’ customers have adequate (or just right) amounts of their products in inventory compared to the previous month, suggesting a demand level that is typically neutral for future new orders and production,” says Fiore.', 'Prices': 'The ISM Prices Index registered 54 percent, 1.1 percentage points higher compared to the July reading of 52.9 percent, indicating raw materials prices increased in August for the eighth straight month after eight consecutive months of decreases. Of the six largest manufacturing industries, four — Chemical Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Transportation Equipment — reported price increases in August. “The Prices Index indicated expansion in August, at a faster rate compared to the previous month. Commodity prices continue to be volatile, especially oil, natural gas, aluminum, corrugate, freight transportation and plastic resins. Steel prices remain at historical lows. Twenty-one percent of companies reported higher prices in August, compared to 23 percent in July,” says Fiore. A Prices Index above 52.8 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials.', 'Backlog of Orders': 'ISM’s Backlog of Orders Index registered 43.6 percent, a gain of 1.9 percentage points compared to the July reading of 41.7 percent, indicating order backlogs contracted for the 23rd consecutive month after a 27-month period of expansion. Of the six largest manufacturing industries, only Computer & Electronic Products reported expanded order backlogs in August. “The index remained in contraction in August, as lower new order and production rates were insufficient to allow backlogs to grow,” says Fiore.', 'New Export Orders': 'ISM’s New Export Orders Index registered 48.6 percent in August, down 0.4 percentage point from July’s reading of 49 percent. “The New Export Orders Index reading indicates that export orders contracted for a third month after expanding in May and contracting in April, with two straight months of expansion before that. New export orders remain sluggish as international trading partners continue to struggle with weak economies,” says Fiore.', 'Imports': 'ISM’s Imports Index continued to indicate cooling in August with a reading of 49.6 percent, an increase of 1 percentage point compared to July’s figure of 48.6 percent. “Imports contracted for the third month in a row after five consecutive months of expansion preceded by 14 consecutive months of contraction. Respondents’ companies have limited their investments in inventory, as growth prospects remain unclear. Ocean freight costs continue to rise, and access to equipment remains challenged,” says Fiore.'}, 'manufacturing_table': '', 'pmi_data': {'New Orders': {'value': 44.6, 'direction': 'Growing'}, 'Production': {'value': 44.8, 'direction': 'Contracting'}, 'Employment': {'value': 43.7, 'direction': 'Growing'}, 'Supplier Deliveries': {'value': 50.5, 'direction': 'Slowing'}, 'Inventories': {'value': 50.3, 'direction': 'Growing'}, "Customers' Inventories": {'value': 48.4, 'direction': 'Slowing'}, 'Prices': {'value': 1.1, 'direction': 'Growing'}, 'Backlog of Orders': {'value': 43.6, 'direction': 'Growing'}, 'New Export Orders': {'value': 48.6, 'direction': 'Growing'}, 'Imports': {'value': 49.6, 'direction': 'Growing'}}}.
