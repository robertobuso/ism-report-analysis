        Pay special attention to correctly identifying:
        - Different classifications based on the index (Growing/Declining for most indices,
          Slower/Faster for Supplier Deliveries, Higher/Lower for Inventories, etc.)
        - The exact list of industries in each category
        - The correct month and year of the report
        
        Ensure all data is correctly identified and structured for further processing.

        1. For each index, organize industries into the correct categories:
           - Growing/Declining for most indices
           - Slower/Faster for Supplier Deliveries
           - Higher/Lower for Inventories
           - Too High/Too Low for Customers' Inventories
        
        2. Ensure industry names are preserved exactly as they appear in the report
        
        3. Keep the original month and year for proper sheet updates
        
        4. Handle any edge cases such as missing categories or inconsistent naming

        1. All expected indices are present
        2. Each index has the appropriate categories
        3. No missing data or incorrect classifications

        Format the validated ISM Manufacturing Report data for Google Sheets and update the sheet.
        
        Requirements:
        1. Check if the Google Sheet exists, create it if it doesn't
        2. Each index should have its own tab
        3. Industries should be rows, months should be columns
        4. Append new data without overwriting previous months
        5. Maintain consistent formatting across all tabs
        6. Handle any existing data gracefully
